# Task-7-SQLite-Database-using-Python

🛍️ Task 7 – Basic Sales Summary from a Tiny SQLite Database using Python
📘 Problem Statement
This task is part of my Data Analyst Internship, focusing on building a basic sales summary using SQL inside Python. The goal is to extract sales insights from a SQLite database, print key metrics, and visualize the results using Matplotlib.

🧰 Tools Used
Python 3 – for scripting and data manipulation.

SQLite3 – built-in SQL engine for small-scale databases.

Pandas – for loading SQL query results into DataFrames.

Matplotlib – for creating simple, effective visualizations.

Google Colab – cloud environment for running the notebook.

💾 Dataset Overview
A fictional store's sales data was simulated, stored in a SQLite database (sales_data.db). The sales table has the following schema:

Column	Type	Description
id	INTEGER	Unique sale ID (auto-increment)
product	TEXT	Name of the product sold
quantity	INTEGER	Quantity sold per transaction
price	INTEGER	Price per unit (₹ INR)

🧪 Sample Data
Product	Quantity	Price
Smartwatch	2	5000
Headphones	3	3000
Hoodie	5	1200
Sneakers	4	2500
Smartwatch	1	5000
Hoodie	2	1200

🔍 SQL Queries and Analysis Performed
1️⃣ Total Quantity and Revenue by Product

SELECT product, 
       SUM(quantity) AS total_qty, 
       SUM(quantity * price) AS revenue 
FROM sales 
GROUP BY product;
Aggregates quantity sold and total revenue for each product.

📊 Chart Highlights (Bar Chart of Revenue by Product)
✅ Smartwatch generated the highest revenue.
✅ Hoodie had the highest quantity sold but a lower unit price.
✅ Headphones and Sneakers showed balanced performance.
